# util-qword
The Qword2 version of `util-linux`, that is, a few essential system management
utils.

## THIS PROJECT IS NOT DEFUNCT.
I see Qword2 as the "unofficial" second version of https://github.com/qword-os/. All thanks goes to the original contributors.

Please do send PRs or open issues against this project which looked at.

You're free to check out the code, fork it, and all that, as long as the license
(LICENSE.md) is respected.

## Implemented utils
- `mount`.
- `qfetch`, a `screenfetch` clone for qword in C.
